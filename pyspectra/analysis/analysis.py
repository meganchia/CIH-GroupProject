        Calculates the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) between two provided images. First, it converts both input images to float32 format. Then, it computes the squared difference between corresponding pixels in the images. Afterward, it calculates the mean squared error (MSE) from the squared differences. In case the MSE is zero (indicating identical images), it returns a message stating that the images are identical with a PSNR value of +Infinity. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum pixel value based on the image bit depth (e.g., 255 for 8-bit images). Finally, it computes the PSNR using the formula PSNR = 20 * log10(MAX) - 10 * log10(MSE), where MAX represents the maximum pixel value. The resulting PSNR value quantifies the similarity between the input images.

        including 'full=True' to return the full SSIM image and 'data_range=1.0' to specify the range of the 
        input image data. Finally, it returns the SSIM value, which represents the similarity between the two 
        input images based on their structural information.
